# Product Vision
"The Candy Crush of strategy games." Manifesting Destiny, a video game set in the Old West, will be a delight for beginners and casual strategy game players. Other turn based strategy games, such as games from the Civilization series, have a steep learning curve. The sheer quantity of resources can easily overwhelm a new player. Manifesting Destiny solves this issue by eliminating the painstaking micro-management of resources and units while offering a user-friendly UI!
