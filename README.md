# Product Vision
"The Candy Crush of strategy games." Manifesting Destiny, a video game set in the Old West, will be a delight for beginners and casual strategy game players. Other turn based strategy games, such as games from the Age of Empires series, have a steep learning curve. The sheer quantity of resources and units can easily overwhelm a new player. Manifesting Destiny solves this issue by eliminating the painstaking micro-management of all those units and resources while offering a user-friendly UI. Only three main resources are used for creating all the buildings and units, while the units themselves have clear purposes and informative descriptions. This leads to a more welcoming and casual experience that's easy for new players to pick up.
